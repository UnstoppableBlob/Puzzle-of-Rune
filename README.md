# Puzzle of Rune

## How to play

You can use a joystick, d-pad, arrow keys, or WASD to move the character around. The goal is to reach the exit, except you will need to be careful, and not step on the same ice tile twice, because that will make it crack. The twist is, that you have to step on each ice tile at least once before exiting the level. 

## How it's made

I made this game using Godot 4.5 stable, and using a script that manages the state of each of the ice tiles independently, changing the image of each tile depending on whether it's regular, cracked, or if it's a whole.
